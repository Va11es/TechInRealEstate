# Pythonizing Property: Unveiling the Binary Code of Real Estate Trends

---

Welcome to my repo! Here you will find my capstone project. This project delves in the relationship between technology and the everevolving landscape of the real estate market. This project zeroes in on the accuracy of real estate website listings and its implications on housing affordability and accessibility, with a specific focus on the state of California. By harnessing data from Zillow, Public Policy Institute of California, and FRED Ecnomoic Data, this endeavor seeks to offer comprehensive insights into the impact of the real estate buying and selling processes. Through meticulous analysis, we aim to shed light on how these technological shifts influence the average American's ability to attain homeownership.
