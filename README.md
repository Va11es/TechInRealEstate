The relationship between technology and real estate has catalyzed a transformative wave, reshaping the industry. For my capstone, I wanted to explore the profound impact technology has had on the real estate market. From the digitization of property listings to the advent of artificial intelligence, our analysis delves into the key drivers, trends, and implications that prop tech has.

In exploring the relationship between technology and real estate, my hypothesis centers around the impact that technological advancements have had on the rapid inflation of property values. While property has traditionally appreciated, technological advancements have taken it to a whole new level. This is evident in the rapid evolution of real estate technology, introducing groundbreaking innovations. The streamlined processes for buying and selling, coupled with increased accessibility, contribute to heightened sales and investor participation, subsequently impacting prices. The integration of big data analytics provides valuable insights, empowering informed decisions and further fueling the demand for homes. In essence, technology has ushered in a transformative phase, amplifying the dynamics of real estate and reshaping its trajectory. Technology is a driving force behind the surge in property values, reshaping the landscape of real estate in unprecedented ways.
